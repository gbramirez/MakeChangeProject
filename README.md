# MakeChangeProject

## Overview

This program simulates a cash register and provides change to customers in the appropriate currency. The cash register will display a greeting to the user and ask the user to input the price of an item. The user will input the item price. The cash register will then ask the user to input the amount of money being paid. The cash register will use the payment response to calculate the user's change. The cash register will then display the user's change in USD denominations ranging from one penny to twenty USD. If the user inputs a payment value that is lower than the required price, the cash register will display an error message.

### Technologies Used

 - Conditionals
 - Java
 - Looping
 - Scanner

### How to Run

- The user will enter an item price when prompted. 
- The user will enter a payment amount when prompted. 
- The cash register will respond with the change value.

### Lessons Learned

I learned how to use IF statements, ELSE IF statements, and WHILE LOOPS in this project. I also learned how to use TRY and CATCH to make the displayed text appear delayed. I used the delayed text to make the cash register appear as if it was calculating information. I believe the appearance of a calculation would allow a customer to believe the cash register is working in a more calculating fashion.
